4. Officially we track issues for Sprint 2 (here)[https://tree.taiga.io/project/davebeach-km-rollout/issues].  To make it into the github issues repository you can do one of the following.
  - On this page, please add a comment where you put /issue at the start.  It is best that you are logged onto your KM mail account, as this will align the comment to the right person etc.
  - In Axure process flow or prototype construction and review.  Axure automatically notifies Slack channel sprint2biz.
  - Or you can create an issue in Taiga, and this will workflow to us for inclusion in github id. [Link here.](https://tree.taiga.io/project/davebeach-km-rollout/issues)
  - The business owns the issues, if you do not agree with an issue, or believe it was closed prematurely, please go in and change it to what it should be at.  The technical team defer to the business, on decisions about issues etc.

5.  If not already done, please sign up to Taiga for a free account.  Then request to be added to the KM-rollout project located [Link here.](https://tree.taiga.io/project/davebeach-km-rollout/).

10.  Email is no longer an acceptable form for this project's design deciscions etc.  If it is email and not on Slack, the requirement doesn't count and will not be done.
